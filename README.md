LIRI BOT NODE APP 

This is my first backend app. LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in commands/parameters and returns data. Kind of like Siri! 


----- How it works ---

Using the command line run node liri.js with one of the following commands,
- concert-this
- spotify-this-song
- movie-this
-do-what-it-says

The spotify command will search the Spotify API and return informatin on the song such as the artist, the album, and a link to a preview. 

The concert command will search the Bands in Town API for an artist or band and return information such as the name of the venue, the location, and date of the event. 

The movie command will search the OMBD API and return information on the movie such as the year, ratings, actors, language, title, and plot. 

The do what it says command will search the Spotify API for 'I want it that way' (from the random.txt file) and return info on the song.
